# Exercism Solutions
Clean, focused solutions to Exercism exercises, grouped by language and kept
easy to browse.

## At a Glance
- **Purpose:** Track my progress and patterns while solving Exercism problems.
- **Organization:** One folder per language under `solutions/`.
- **Growth:** New language folders will be added as I explore more tracks.

## Notes
Each language folder contains the exercise files provided by Exercism alongside
my solutions. The structure mirrors the track layout to keep navigation simple.
